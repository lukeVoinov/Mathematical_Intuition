Maximizing Water Stored in a Bottle Tilted at an Angle

# Story and Motivation

A few days ago I was at my school's gym playing the best game of badminton in my life when we decided to stop for a break. I went to the nearest water fountain to fill up y water bottle but encountered an obstacle: the only way I could fill my bottle was if I tilted it at an angle. This then led to water spilling out before the entire bottle could fill, leaving a substantial volume filled with air (insert photo of fountain, description "water fountain in gym"). In computer science we are taught to implement efficient algorithms and data structures; to write efficient comments; to use AI to improve productivity (another words for efficiency). Entire studies on artificial intelligence and algorithms would be impossible to conduct without the foundational Big O notation. It is the job of colleges to engrain a desire for efficiency in their computer science students, which would explain the reason I was annoyed that my bottle was not completely filled. Or maybe I'm just lazy and do not want to have to make a second trip to the fountain where one would have sufficed. Whatever prompted me to do all this math and writing goes beyond just a simple annoyance: I wanted to do this project to try and understand what it looks like when physicists employ (albeit at a much more sophisticated level) critical and creative thinking. I also wanted to prove to myself that I am not wasting time in school: that I have learned something, in the first place, and that I am able to apply that something. Therefore this project acted as a fun logic puzzle that demonstrated to me that I am actually able to apply what I have learned. I discuss some things I learned in the Conclusions section.



# Conclusion

What did I learn: patience, verifying soultions, what I enjoy, how to convert a concept/idea into math
